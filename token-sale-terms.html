<h2>Terms and Conditions for TMX Token Sale</h2>

<p>The following terms and conditions (“Terms and Conditions”) apply to any purchase of TMX during the pre-sale and public sale phases, the cryptographic digital utility token (“Token”) that Trademindx.com (“Company”) intends for release in connection with the Trademindx project (“Project”), by the purchaser (“Purchaser”), through the sale of Tokens on the Ethereum blockchain (“Sale”), for distribution on or about May 2, 2018 (“Release Date”), in conjunction with development of the Trademindx platform (“Platform”).</p>

<h3>1. Grant of Right to Receive Tokens and Platform Use License.</h3>
<p>Subject to completion of the Sale, Company shall deliver to Purchaser, via smart contract programmed prior to the Release Date, the amount of Tokens to which Purchaser will be entitled pursuant to the Sale outcome. In tandem, Company shall grant to Purchaser a nonexclusive license to use such Tokens on the Platform and contribute to development of the Project in harmony with these Terms and Conditions.</p>

<h3>2. Projected Token Functionality.</h3>
<p>As reflected in the published White Paper, Company intends the Tokens for two primary utilities: (a) to act as a use license for the Platform (subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6 below); and, (b) third-party and community derived use cases. In addition, Company intends that Token holders may commit (or, stake) Tokens on smart contracts to redeem Platform services or to pay Platform fees. Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the functionality of Tokens based on needs and development of the Project, technological factors, or any other consideration that impacts timely and proper Token release or Platform functionality.</p>

<h3>3. Tokens Provided on an “As Is” Basis.</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding Paragraph 2 above, Purchaser understands and agrees that Tokens shall be provided “as is,” with no further representation or warranty of any kind.</p>

<p>Purchaser understands and agrees that pre-order purchase or receipt of Tokens: (a) does not provide Purchaser with any claim with respect to Company and its assets; (b) is not a loan to Company; and, (c) does not provide Purchaser with any ownership, proprietary, shareholder, or investor interest in Company or the Project. Furthermore ownership of Tokens carries no rights other than the right to use them as a means to enable usage of and interaction with the Platform, if successfully completed and deployed. Tokens do not represent or confer any ownership right or stake, share or security or equivalent rights, or any right to receive future revenue shares, intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the Platform.</p>

<h3>5. No Partnership and No Agency.</h3>
<p>Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a partnership, association, joint venture, or other co-operative entity or endeavor between Purchaser and Company. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a designation of either Purchaser or Company as an agent of the other for any purpose.</p>

<h3>6. Assumption of Risk: Purchaser Sophistication; Understanding of Token Purposes and Revocable Platform Use License; No Guarantee of Monetary Value.</h3>
<p>In placing this pre-order purchase, Purchaser affirms that s/he has conducted adequate research and possesses sufficient knowledge and experience in blockchain technology and cryptographic tokens to evaluate the risks and merits of the Tokens, and that s/he is able to bear the risks thereof. Purchaser further affirms his/her understanding that the Tokens are intended for utility purposes in powering the Project and facilitating Platform functions and community growth, governance, and development, and that Purchaser’s primary reason for this pre-order purchase is an intention to join the Platform and participate as a member. Purchaser agrees to hold, use, or transfer Tokens lawfully, and to forfeit his/her license to participate in the Platform as a member if, in Company’s sole discretion, Purchaser violates any of these Terms and Conditions or any fair and reasonable Platform community guideline(s) duly adopted for implementation in the course of the Project. Purchaser acknowledges that his/her use license shall expire upon the sale, transfer, or loss of Tokens, and that safe and secure storage of private cryptographic keys required for access to any purchased Tokens is Purchaser’s sole responsibility. Additionally, Purchaser affirms his/her understanding that, to the extent that Tokens may assume monetary exchange value at any point, such value may experience volatility, or increase or decrease, over time. No guarantee is made concerning the value, if any, of Tokens, or any market platform for their resale or transfer outside the Platform.</p>

<h3>7. Compliance.</h3>
<p>Protection of member and user privacy in accordance with Platform participant and industry standards is a top priority. Purchaser understands that Company and the Project may be subject to certain regulations that necessitate legal compliance mechanisms and/or preservation of Purchaser information and Platform data pursuant to law.</p>
